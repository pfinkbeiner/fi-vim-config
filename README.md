# fi-vim-config
This repository contains my current vim config with all plugins that i love to use. Every plugin is included as a submodule for easy updating.

For a detailed description of each plugin I would recommend their own git repository.

## Usage
`git clone --recursive git@github.com:pfinkbeiner/fi-vim-config.git ~/.vim`
